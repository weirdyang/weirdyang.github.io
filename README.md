Lately, my relationship with food has gotten really messy. I’ve somehow convinced myself that I have to “earn” every bite through exercise. So when I get sick and have to rest, I just... don’t eat. It’s easier than it should be, since I lose my appetite anyway. But then, of course, that backfires—eventually, I get frustrated and end up bingeing. It’s a constant swing between extremes, and I don’t even trust my own hunger cues anymore. Am I actually hungry? Or is it just my messed-up mindset talking?

To deal with this, I’ve started treating eating like an experiment—trying new things, approaching each meal as its own thing rather than part of some bigger pattern. It’s the total opposite of how I was as a kid. Back then, I was overweight but genuinely loved food. Special occasions meant exciting feasts, and I actually looked forward to eating. Now, food feels like a chore, something I can never seem to do “right.” No matter what, I feel out of control, like I’m breaking some rule I didn’t even agree to.

At the core of it all, I think I just don’t trust my future self. I don’t believe I’ll be able to lose any weight I gain, or get back on track after being sick, or stick to better habits long-term. That doubt keeps me stuck in this cycle, afraid to just eat like a normal person. I wish I could figure out how to break out of it.
