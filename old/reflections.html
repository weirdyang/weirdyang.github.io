            <p>Breaking a habit requires simply stopping, but not doing something feels unnatural. Humans are wired for action—we prefer doing over not doing. Ironically, trying not to think about something only makes it more present in our minds. We crave busyness, which is why work feels so essential—it gives us purpose, direction, and a reason to act.</p>

            <p>Idleness, on the other hand, leaves us alone with our thoughts, forcing us to dwell on our mistakes and uncertainties. But self-reflection is a loop with no end—the eye cannot see itself, the knife cannot cut its own edge. Excessive self-analysis rarely leads to clarity or transformation.</p>

            <p>Meaning is found not in endless introspection but in action, experience, and connection. Life exists outside of us, in relationships, in shared moments, in the exploration of others. Every human is a universe unto themselves, waiting to be discovered. Don't spend your life trapped in your own mind when an entire cosmos of people is out there, ready to be known.</p>
